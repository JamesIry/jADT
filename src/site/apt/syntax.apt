    The syntax of a JADT file is

+---
    DOC : PACKAGE IMPORTS DATATYPES
    PACKAGE : "package" PACKAGENAME
    IMPORTS : IMPORT*
    IMPORT : "import" PACKAGENAME
    DATATYPE : DATATYPE+
    DATATYPE : DATATYPENAME TYPEARGS? "=" CONSTRUCTORS
    DATATYPENAME : IDENTIFIER
    TYPEARGS : "<" IDENTIFIER ("," IDENTIFIER)* ">"
    CONSTRUCTORS : CONSTRUCTOR ("|" CONSTRUCTOR)*
    CONSTRUCTOR : CONSTRUCTORNAME ("(" ARGS ")")?
    ARGS : ARG ("," ARG)*
    ARG : TYPE ARGNAME
    TYPE : ARRAY | JAVAPRIMITIVE | TYPENAME ("<" TYPELIST ">")?
    ARRAY : TYPE "[]"
    JAVAPRIMITIVE : "boolean" | "char" | "double" |
                    "float" | "int" | "long" | "short"
    TYPENAME : IDENTIFIER
    TYPELIST : TYPE ("," TYPELIST )?
    ARGNAME : IDENTIFIER
    PACKAGENAME : valid Java package name
    IDENTIFIER : valid Java identifier

    Lexical conventions    

      * JADT is case sensitive.

      * Java style comments, both end of line (//) and block (/* */), are allowed.

      * Whitespace isn't significant other than for separating tokens.

      * End of line characters are just treated as whitespace.  

      * There's no need for semicolons or other end markers.

      * Java keywords cannot be used as identifiers or package names.

      * The punctuation "=" "," "<" ">" "(" ")" serves as both tokens and token separators.  E.g. the data type definition "Foo=Bar|Baz" is parsed the same as "Foo = Bar | Baz"
